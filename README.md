# Goods navigation and price estimation tool
Machine learning-driven goods price and state estimator based on text description and image

## Overview
Now this project is positioned almost only as idea (codebase is tiny - small avito parse helper for single category).  
Unfortunately I have very limited time to maintain and develop it, that's why I don't promise regular updates and great code quality, but I'm open to any suggestions (including bug reports, feature request, ideas and pull requests).  
Feel free to contact me if you found this idea useful/interesting!

## Parsers
For large database firstly a lot of data should be collected - it's a main goal for these scripts.
* avito.ru
* ebay.com (TODO)
* irr.ru (TODO)
* auto.ru (TODO)
* ubu.ru (TODO)

## Price estimation
Need database with similar type things (with age and city)

## Quality estimation
Mainly should be done for cars by photo and text description

## Contribution
Any help is highly desirable - let's create awesome universal remote quality and price estimation tool!
